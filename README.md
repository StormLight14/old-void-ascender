# Void Ascender
Fast-paced platformer game being created in Godot 4.

## Playing
You can clone this repo and open with Godot 4, use a Release from Github, or play a probably outdated and buggy version online here: https://stormlight14.itch.io/void-ascender-test.

## About
The player must go upwards through each level to complete it. They need to get to the end of the level before the void reaches them.

## Some stuffs I've done so far
- [x] Basic movement
- [x] (Some) Controller support
- [x] Inventory system
- [x] Level system, although obscure right now
- [x] Stab stab and pew pew (Melee and ranged weapons)

## Contributing
Feel free to make pull requests to improve any code I've written!
