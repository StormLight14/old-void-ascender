# Void Ascender
Fast-paced platformer game being created in Godot 4.

## Playing
Since the game isn't finished, either clone this project and open with Godot 4, or play a probably outdated version here: https://stormlight14.itch.io/void-ascender-test.

## About
The player must go upwards through each level to complete it. They need to get to the end of the level before the void reaches them.

## Contributing
Feel free to make pull requests to improve any code I've written!
